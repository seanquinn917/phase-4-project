## Usage

Welcome to my Phase-4 project.  The focus on this project was was to create a full stack, user-driven environment.  What a user interacts with is functional, and simple styled.  When a user visits http://localhost:3000/login, they can either login with a Username password that has already been saved to the databae, or they can click the link to signup and add their credentials to create a profile and gain access.  Either after log in or Signup being complete successfully, they access a list of individual movies that are complete with directors, genres and a link to InsiderInfo which navigates to the individual movie's page.  
The main list of movies comes complete with a form to add you own move to the database.  That movie can also be deleted. 
Once on the main page of the movie, a user can read all of the reviews left by other users in the database.  They can add, edit and delete their own reviews only as they are not authorized to edit other user's additions.
